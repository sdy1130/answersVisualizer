               <p>
                Death continues to be a taboo subject within the general public and 
                many may feel uneasy while engaging in conversations with their loved ones 
                about this topic. The need for discussions around end-of-care life is a vital 
                aspect in fulfilling patients’ wishes for the management of health towards 
                the later stages of life.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                This project aims to raise awareness about the importance of advance care 
                planning and to normalize conversations around end-of-life care. We hope 
                that the collated responses to these questions will promote self-reflection 
                on one’s health care wishes and allow others to have a greater insight on 
                this topic. 
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                The next step of this project includes an analysis of the collected, 
                anonymized responses and the creation of a summary report highlighting 
                key trends, patterns, and findings.

                  During their pharmacy school clinical rotations, 
                  Rachel and Jamie have come to realize how the neglect 
                  and absence of advance care planning has compromised the 
                  quality of care patients receive, leading to much uncertainty,
                  confusion, and regret among family members and loved ones. This
                  led to the birth of this project - The End: A Hopeful
                  Chapter of Life. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Rachel and Jamie hope to empower the general public with taking 
                  charge of their healthcare management, engaging in conversations,
                  and dispelling any fears that are often associated with end-of-life care.
                  Through this online avenue, helpful resources can also be shared to a 
                  wider audience of varying ages, cultures, and geographical location.

                  Charlie is a software engineer at Google Health and has graduated from
                  the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science, Electrical 
                  and Computer Engineering major. He is genuinely passionate about the 
                  healthcare field and making a positive impact through the use of technology.
                  It has been a great pleasure for him to join Rachel and Jamie and develop 
                  an application for this project.
